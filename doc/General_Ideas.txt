GENERAL NOTES

    COMBAT
        2 actions per turn
            offensive move (sword technique(more than just a swing), spell, shoot a bow(options for speed, strength, accuracy etc. - depending on the type of bow))
            defensive prep (tank("raise shield"), dodge("sheath weapon(s)"), parry("raise weapon"))
            move (step(half movement, advantage against swipes - opportunity atks), stride(normal movement))
            item (use potion, throw bomb, etc.)
            interact (turn crank, flip table, cut rope, etc.)
        Notes:
            some of each category may cost a whole turn, or 2 actions
            you can do anything twice except defense prep
            side actions like ducking behind cover take no actions
        Attack metrics:
            splash (number of targets), damage (per target), status effect, range, accuracy, prerequisites (having to load the crossbow), cost (stamina or mana)
