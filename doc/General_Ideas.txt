GENERAL NOTES

    COMBAT
        2 actions per turn
            offensive move (sword technique(more than just a swing), spell, shoot a bow(options for speed, strength, accuracy etc. - depending on the type of bow))
            defensive prep (tank("raise shield"), dodge("sheath weapon(s)"), parry("raise weapon"))
            move (step(half movement, advantage against swipes - opportunity atks), stride(normal movement))
            item (use potion, throw bomb, etc.)
            interact (turn crank, flip table, cut rope, etc.)
        Notes:
            some of each category may cost a whole turn, or 2 actions
            you can do anything twice except defense prep
            side actions like ducking behind cover take no actions
        Attack metrics:
            splash (number of targets), damage (per target), status effect, range, accuracy, prerequisites (having to load the crossbow), cost (stamina or mana)

        Specific Gameplay
            Tanking - you move a short distance from your current location and prepare a defense move. You may move 5 feet in any direction from your current position to block
            an oncoming attack at a much reduced cost. From that position you may move another 5 feet (any direction) to block another attack, and so on until you no longer have
            enough stamina to buy a block action out of turn

            Dodging - you move a short distance from your current location to prepare to dodge (you put your weapons down to allow for better movement). You may move 15 feet in any direction from your current position to (attempt to) dodge an oncoming
            attack at a much reduced cost. You may keep doing this until you run out of stamina to buy another.

            Parrying - same as tanking except you risk taking full damage if the parry fails. You can no longer parry out of turn that round if you fail a parry.

            Adrenaline points - acts as a combat's forward momentum - players earn them by accomplishing main combat goals: killing enemies, saving civilians, venturing deep into enemy territory, etc.

            Three main pillars of gameplay: - feel free to mix these together! aiming for not needing to pick a specific class, but build a fluid stat block around synergies

                Warrior
                    berserker - single-target-damage-dominant: uses axes, swords, clubs... uses adrenaline points to get closer to the enemy (jumping, grappling, setting on fire with magic)
                        - abilities allow them to move as they attack, gain adrenaline from consistently killing an enemy every turn (could be slashing away a fireball if fighting a dragon)
                    defender - defense-dominant: uses spears, hammers, swords... uses adrenaline points to do short range splash damage and knockback
                        - gain adrenaline from blocking huge damage, allowing them to turn around and spend it on a massive hit the next turn

                Rogue
                    marksman - range-dominant: uses guns, bows, crossbows, throwing knives- also can shoot arrows that have bombs and shit on them... uses adrenaline to bounce and dodge, set up traps
                        - gain adrenaline by hitting trick shots, long shots, critical hits... then spend them on increased movement speed or probability buffs
                    assassin - stealth-dominant: uses daggers, poison, hand to hand, brutal magic (maybe tattoos that have special effects like stone flesh)... uses adrenaline to do very high single target sneak damage, parry attacks, vanish
                        - gain adrenaline by executing enemies that still had some health left in them... spend adrenaline on increased dodge chance, stealth chance, reduced tattoo mana cost

                Mage
                    sorceror - splash-damage-dominant: uses tons of mana to cast firey explosions, lightning, hailstorms, etc... uses adrenaline to feed a shifting mana pool
                        - gain adrenaline by hitting many enemies in a single blow... spend to increase total mana or mana regen speed for that combat
                    scholar - status-effect-dominant: has a very large book of spells that can be prepped each day that do a wide range things: transmutation, slow/haste, teleport, mage-shield... uses adrenaline to unlock higher tier spells
                        - gain adrenaline by using all available spells, then move to the next tier of spells once those are done with an adrenaline point (like gun game)

                example: marksman berserker - equip dual hand cannons and a grappling hook to keep chaining together small kills at medium range

                example: defender scholar - equip plate armor and a staff for a mix of mage shield tanking and earthquake staff strikes

                example: assassin sorceror - use tons of tattoos like that aid in melee with elemental damage buffs, explode out of stealth with lightning bolts

    UI
        region screen (world map) - active when party is traveling between areas
            will not be shown much - think between huge events
            gives options of which regions can be traveled to based on current location within a region
            gives basic description of what party knows about a selected region
            HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ENCOUNTERS

        area screen (main map) - active when party is traveling between landmarks
            shown often after party completes encounter and leaves landmark to continue their journey
            gives options for which landmarks can be traveled to based on current landmark location within the area
                will give an approximation of travel time, distance, difficulty, things the party knows to look out for, etc
                can select a landmark for travel
                    will decide based on a dice roll if a travel encounter is tripped
                    will construct intermediate landmarks if a travel encounter is necessary
            gives basic description of what happened at a landmark and what the party knows about landmarks in general
            gives info about what encounters could be drawn in the area

        landmark screen
            gives description of immediate surroundings
            allows for players to look around, may have loot, secrets, etc
            gives current progress on encounter if an encounter is active

    LORE
        Basic background for player characters:
            player characters are brought back from the dead by a curse that someone in their previous life had laid upon them

            The curse allows a necromancer to force them into his service - namely that of traveling to and dispatching his enemies for him

    IMPLEMENTATION
        create a directory structure for campaigns, regions, areas, landmarks, encounters, objects, all assets in /gamedata/assets
        -> have an option to import game assets to current campaign datatype in edit menus
