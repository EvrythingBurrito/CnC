CAVES AND COCKATRICES TO DO

Create the Vaadin/Hibernate web app environment
    ##### THE BONES
        finish bones for GM and player main views
        Explore JavaFX with a standalone application
            then try to surmise how one can interact with the rest of the vaadin front-end system
        add NPC, landmark, area, and region objects to fit into the game state with the player objects
            Need to add region/area/landmark views for the Vaadin GM UI and eventually JavaFX layers to display game state changes (player screens are independent of game state)
        finish bones for GM game environment states
            ----> this will probably just look like the GM controlling exactly what state everything is in through their UI login
            This means GM is able to move the game in and out of different state views and the views update on player UIs accordingly
    ##### ENCOUNTER DESIGN
        add the bones for encounters
            make player/GM/Mainscreen views for verbal NPC interactions
            make player/GM/Mainscreen views for environment interactions
            make player/GM/Mainscreen views for combat interactions
        add functionality to encounters
            flesh out details for each encounter so they affect player conditions
